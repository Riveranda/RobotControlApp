# RobotControlApp
<h3>This project is a simple Android application, written in Kotlin, used to control a raspberry pi robot.</h3>
<h4> Server Sockets </h4></br>
Communication with the raspberry pi is done via a low level implementation of Kotlin's server sockets.</br>
These server sockets are contained within an Android Service, and feature auto-reconnect and error handling. </br>
With the proper setup, sever sockets allow one to communicate over local networks with ease, and even over</br>
broader internet. </br>
<h4> User Interface </h4></br>
The UI was designed to be extremely simple, and obfuscate the user from the complicated backend.</br>
